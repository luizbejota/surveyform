# surveyform

Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pok√©mon!
My name is Luiz! People call me the Front-end Design student!
This form is a drill for a course called freeCodeCamp! (https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)
For some people, freeCodeCamp is hard. Others use it to train code skills. Myself... I study freeCodeCamp because I want to change professions.

READER!
My very own freeCodeCamp legend is about to unfold! 
A world of dreams and adventures with freeCodeCamp awaits! Let's go!
